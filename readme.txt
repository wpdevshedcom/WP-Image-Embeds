Smart image SEO for WordPress sites. Passively build links back to your site by letting other webmasters embed your images in their site.

== Description ==

Attracting links to your site is the hard part of SEO. Ideally your content will speak for itself and naturally attract links over time. But why not encourage linking by making it easy for other webmasters to link to you?

If you have unique and interesting images, photos, or infographics on your site the chances are that other webmasters are already picking these up and using them on their own sites. That’s great if they link back to you, but many won’t. This is why we built WP Image Embeds. It is a simple plugin designed to make it easy for other webmasters to embed your images, while at the same time linking back to you.
